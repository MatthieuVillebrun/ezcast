# How to install EZcast ?

## Requirements

In order to use EZrecorder, you need to install / enable several components:

- Apache2
- MySQL 5.x 
- PHP5.3 ( or greater ) with following extensions activated:
  -curl
  -APC (for performance and upload progress bar PHP 5.3->5.4 )
  -OPCache (for performance on PHP 5.5 )
  -ldap
  -pdo_mysql 
- ssh (unix command, usually installed by default)
- at (unix command, usually installed by default)
- rsync (unix command, usually installed by default)

## Quick Installation

1. Download the latest available version of EZcast from our Git repository http://podcast.ulb.ac.be/...
2. Create a MySQL database for EZcast on your server (grant all privileges on the database).
3. Put the EZcast directory wherever you want on your server (we recommend to place it under « /usr/local/ezcast»)
4. Edit the php.ini file to increase max file size upload.
5. Launch the « install.sh » script as root from the EZcast directory and follow the instructions.
6. Open the EZadmin page in your web browser for the configuration of EZcast and all of its components. This is a one-time operation
`i.e :   http://my.server.address/ezadmin`
#

## Detailed installation 

1. Download the source code

Open your terminal and call Git in command line to download the source code of EZcast
root# cd <wherever you want to install ezcast>
root# git clone http://podcast.ulb.ac.be/ezcast

2. Create a MySQL database

Open your terminal and call mysql in command line to create a user and the database for EZadmin. 
The database will be used to store users and courses for the EZcast components. 
Make sure you have sufficient permissions to create a user and a database in MySQL. If you don't, call your database administrator.

Please refer to the following example to configure your database. Variables between < > are explained here below. 

```
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password :
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5340 to server version: 3.23.54

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

Mysql> CREATE USER <ezcast_user_name> IDENTIFIED BY <ezcast_password>;

mysql> CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <database_name>.* TO "<ezcast_user_name>"@"<host>";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
 
mysql> create database ezcast;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)


Mysql> exit
Bye
$
```

In the above example : 

    * ezcast or ezadmin are typical values for <ezcast_user_name>
    * ezcast is a typical value for <database_name>
    * <host> is usually localhost. If you do not know this value, consult your sysadmin. 
    * Feel free to choose a safe password for <ezcast_user>

Please keep in mind these values (you will need them in a further step)


3. Move the EZcast directory

Now you have to decide where you want to install EZcast and its components. We recommend you to install it under « /usr/local/ » directory. 

```
cd
#change user to be root (alternatively, use 'sudo bash' depending on the distribution)
su
#following line creates the directories /usr/local/ if they don’t exist yet
mkdir –p /usr/local/
#moves the ezcast directory from current user’s home dir to /usr/local
#change the following path if you want to install ezcast somewhere else
mv ezcast /usr/local
```

4. Edit php.ini

Since EZmanager allows you to submit your own video files, it may come handy to increase the max file size for upload.

```
# this depends on your distribution 
vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
# change upload_max_filesize in the ‘File uploads’ section
upload_max_filesize = 2000M 
```

5. Execute the ‘install.sh’ script for installing EZcast

Go in the ezcast folder. Make sure the file ‘install.sh’ can be executed. Launch the ‘install.sh’ script as root and follow the instructions written on the screen.

```
<?php
#change user to be root (may be ‘sudo’ depending on the distribution)
su
#move to the ezcast directory (change the path if you have installed ezcast somewhere else)
cd /usr/local/ezcast
#change permissions for install.sh
chmod 755 install.sh
#execute install.sh
./install.sh
```

6. Configure EZcast

You are now going to configure EZcast and its components. For this part of the installation, please open your favorite web browser.

Go to the EZadmin webpage. At the first visit, you will be requested to enter some information required by EZcast to run. 

```
http://your.server.address/ezadmin
``` 
If you prefere to configure EZcast by editing the file manually, go to the EZcast folder. For each subdirectories (ezmanager / ezadmin / ezplayer / common), edit the ‘config-sample.inc’ file to match your configuration and rename it ‘config.inc’.

EZcast is now partially installed. Before using it, please install EZrenderer, which is required to process the submitted movies. EZrenderer can be installed on the same machine or on a remote machine. The complete installation is described in [add location].
You can also install EZrecorder which is the interface used to record in the classroom.

Once EZrenderer has been installed, you can access the different interfaces using the following URL’s.

```
http://your.server.address/ezadmin
http://your.server.address/ezmanager
http://your.server.address/ezplayer
```
